                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hello,
                    My name is Anna Colberg, and I'm currently in the middle of my apprenticeship in web development. 
                    As part of an intensive bootcamp, I'm learning the fundamentals of modern web technologies such as 
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Git and GitHub.

                    What I particularly enjoy about this field is the ability to combine creativity with technology 
                    and develop solutions.
                    I'm curious, quick to learn, and determined – exploring new content independently or quickly 
                    familiarizing myself with complex topics is one of my strengths.

                    In addition to my professional development, I place great value on teamwork and collaboration. 
                    I enjoy working with others, sharing knowledge, and growing together on projects. Openness, reliability, and respectful interaction are a given for me.

                    My goal is to continuously expand my skills, develop professional web solutions, 
                    and work in an environment that encourages innovation, creativity, and team spirit.
                </p>

                <h2>About my family Life</h2>
                <p>I met my husband in the German Armed Forces in 2017.
                Our son, Jeremy, was born in December 2018. Jeremy is now in school.
                My husband and I married in July 2024, and one month later our second son, Elias, was born.

                We live together with our three dogs.
                Our chickens, quail, and ducks also live on our large property of almost 2,000 square meters.

                We also plan to build on our property in 2026.
